        <p>What I had to do to squeeze this recipe from my neighbor...but it's worth it. This is a scrumptious version of sticky chicken</p>
        <h4>Ingridients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup prepared barbecue sauce </li>
            <li>¼ cup soy sauce </li>
            <li>¼ cup maple syrup </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dry mustard powder </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch </li>
            <li>1 cup water </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk together the barbecue sauce, soy sauce, red wine, maple syrup, chili powder, dry mustard powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin in a bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken breasts into a 9x13-inch baking dish, and pour the sauce over the chicken. Turn the chicken pieces over in the sauce to coat both sides.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the baking dish, and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Pour the remaining sauce into a saucepan, place over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Whisk the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until smooth. Whisk the cornstarch mixture into the sauce; reduce heat to a simmer, and allow the sauce to thicken, whisking constantly. Return the chicken to the dish, and pour the thickened sauce over the chicken to serve.</li>
        </ol>
